# MITRE ATT&CK App for Splunk 3.14.0‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRelease Highlights

## 1. What is MITRE ATTACK App for Splunk?

[**MITRE ATTACK App for Splunk**](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4617) extends the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** by providing **compliance and triage dashboards**, **correlation search mapping**, and **drill-down analysis**. These capabilities help security teams effectively **operationalize ATT&CK** within their **SIEM workflows**.

**Key Features:**

* **ATT&CK Matrix Visualization:** Interactive dashboard showing adversary techniques.

* **Integration with Splunk ES & ESCU:** Maps correlation searches to ATT&CK techniques.

* **Detection Coverage Overview:** Highlights strengths and gaps in detection coverage.

* **Custom Rule Mapping:** Allows manual or lookup-based ATT&CK alignment for custom searches.

* **Drill-Down Analysis:** Enables quick investigation from matrix to Analyst Queue.

* **Automated Data Lookups:** Keeps visualizations and mappings up to date via scheduled searches.

## 2. What‚Äôs New in the MITRE ATTACK App for Splunk (3.14.0)

**Release:** 3.14.0 ‚Äî **Date:** Oct 30, 2025

**Version 3.14.0** introduces a refreshed layout and enhanced visualization experience, making it easier to navigate between tactics, techniques, and detection mappings.

The redesigned interface improves usability and provides a more intuitive workflow for analysts exploring ATT&CK coverage and investigation data. In this release, we‚Äôve also introduced a **new lookup populated with externally provided threat actor data**, which serves as the foundational source for a **new dashboard**. This dashboard enables analysts to perform investigations and analyses based on threat actor information, offering deeper visibility into adversary behaviors and related detections.

Together, these updates enhance the **MITRE ATT&CK App for Splunk** with a refreshed UI and a new threat actor lookup, helping security teams operationalize the ATT&CK framework with greater precision and efficiency.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the new updates:

### **2.1. Layout Redesign:**

The **Configuration** and **Setup** sections remain unchanged. However, the main dashboards have been reorganized under two new **dropdown menus**: **Compliance** and **Incidents**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/blog/2025-10-30-new-panels.webp" width="600"/>
</p>

**Compliance:**

* **MITRE ATT&CK Compliance** ‚Üí Now located under the **Compliance** dropdown as **ATT&CK Matrix**.

* Two new panels have been added under this section, powered by newly introduced lookup: **Threat Actor** and **Threat Actor (Table)**. The next section provides a closer look at how these panels work.

**Incidents:**

* **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix** ‚Üí Now accessible under the **Incidents** dropdown as **ATT&CK Matrix**.

* **MITRE ATT&CK Triggered Tactics & Techniques** ‚Üí Now available under the **Incidents** dropdown as **Tactics & Techniques**.

This redesign streamlines navigation and enhances usability by grouping related dashboards under clear dropdown menus, allowing analysts to switch seamlessly between **compliance** and **incident** views.

### **2.2. New Lookup:**

As part of this release, a new lookup has been introduced to support threat actor‚Äìbased analysis within the MITRE ATT&CK App. This lookup provides a structured way to associate **threat actors** with the **ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques** they are known to use. The data is externally provided and serves as the foundation for the new **Threat Actor** and **Threat Actor (Table)** dashboards.

**Lookup Path:**

DA-ESS-MitreContent/lookups/mitre_threat_actor_lookup.csv

**Example Lookup:**

    Agrius,AjaxSecurityTeam,Whitefly
    T1583,T1555.003,T1059
    T1059.003,,T1588.002
    ,,T1003.001

**Explanation:**

* The **header row** (first line) contains the names of the threat actors (e.g., *Agrius*, *AjaxSecurityTeam*, *Whitefly*).

* ‚ö†Ô∏è The header values should **not contain any whitespace**.

* The **subsequent rows** list the **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** and **sub-techniques** associated with each threat actor.

**Example Interpretation:**

* The group **Agrius** is mapped to techniques **T1583** and **T1059.003**.

* **AjaxSecurityTeam** is mapped to **T1555.003**.

* **Whitefly** is mapped to **T1059**, **T1588.002**, and **T1003.001**.

This structure allows the dashboards to **correlate threat actors with the ATT&CK techniques they employ**, providing a **clear, technique-based perspective on adversary behavior and coverage**.

The lookup dynamically feeds the new **Threat Actor** and **Threat Actor (Table)** panels, allowing analysts to explore detections and correlations based on known adversary profiles.

### **2.3. New Dashboard:**

**Threat Actor:**
This dashboard provides a **threat actor‚Äìcentric compliance view** built from a dedicated lookup table, where each entry maps an actor (via threat actor name) to the **MITRE ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques** they are known to use. Unlike the standard MITRE ATT&CK Compliance dashboard, which focuses on tactics and overall coverage, **this dashboard emphasizes threat actor behavior**, helping security teams assess which adversary techniques are most relevant to their environment and identify potential gaps in detection and defense. To use it, create a lookup based on your own threat actor database or the provided seed list, then explore the visuals to analyze technique and sub-technique coverage.

Here‚Äôs a simple example dashboard that uses the lookup mentioned above. The color scheme follows the same logic as the MITRE ATT&CK Compliance dashboard (now renamed ATT&CK Matrix).

</p>

The **‚ÄúFilter by Threat Actor‚Äù** option lets you display only the correlation searches and MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with a specific threat actor (e.g., Agrius, AjaxSecurityTeam, Whitefly). The other filtering options work the same way as in the previous dashboards, and the **Filter by Threat Actor** field defaults to **ALL**.

</p>

**Threat Actor (Table):** 
This table displays the rule names, associated MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs, and the count of rules based on the underlying query results.

</p>

The **Filter by Technique ID** option allows filtering the results by specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques. By default, it is set to **ALL**.

</p>

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** You can change the default configuration from the **Edit** menu on the right side of the screen. You will see a screen like the one below, where you can specify your options.
