# Automate Your Splunk Queries with splunk_query_runner

Are you tired of running repetitive queries in Splunk manually? Do you need a way to schedule and automate the export of your results? Introducing **splunk_query_runner**, a lightweight command-line utility designed to simplify Splunk querying and output management. 

With this tool, you can use a CSV input file along with your authentication token for seamless operation. It‚Äôs perfect for automation pipelines, scheduled reporting, or simply reducing the effort involved in repetitive query tasks. You can download the app and find more information in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seynur/restore-archive-for-splunk/tree/main/splunk_query_runner).

## What is splunk_query_runner?

The [`splunk_query_runner`](https://github.com/seynur/restore-archive-for-splunk/blob/main/splunk_query_runner/README.md) is a command-line tool designed to simplify and automate the execution of Splunk searches via the REST API. Instead of logging into the Splunk Web UI, copying queries, setting time ranges, and exporting results manually, this tool allows you to define everything once in a CSV file and run it with a single command.

At its core, it functions as a lightweight scheduler and execution engine for Splunk searches. You prepare a list of searches (SPL), time ranges, and output preferences in a structured CSV file. The tool then parses this file, authenticates to Splunk using your token or credentials, executes each query, and saves the results to local files in your chosen format (CSV or JSON).

Whether you‚Äôre querying index searches (`index=xxx`), saved searches (`| savedsearch`), data model queries (`| tstats`), or database queries (`| dbxquery`), the `splunk_query_runner` can handle them all. It is particularly useful for automating reports, scheduling routine data pulls, or integrating Splunk data into external systems without the need to set up complex workflows.

Additionally, the project includes helpful scripts to:

- Generate authentication tokens (`create_splunk_tokens`)
- Dynamically update time ranges if you are trying to schedule reports (`update_dates_for_input_files`)
- Clean up old outputs and orchestrate the entire process (`all_runner_script`)

Whether you are a developer automating security reports, a data engineer scheduling exports, or a Splunk administrator running batch jobs, the `splunk_query_runner` can streamline your workflow with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.

### Key Features

- Run Splunk queries using the REST API
- Supports token-based authentication and username/password authentication
- Handles rising-column dbxquery scenarios
- Compatible with tstats, indexed searches, and saved searches
- Outputs in CSV or JSON formats
- Offers CLI support with configurable input and output paths
- Enables time-based automation with dynamic date updates

---

## How it works
The process begins by executing the `all_runner_script`. This script prepares the necessary environment, updates the dates in the input CSV file, and deletes any old output files. Once the environment is ready, it runs the Python script `splunk_query_runner.py` (So don't forget to install python üòä and change the mode of all files to be executed).

The Python script reads queries from the `input_list.csv` file, establishes a connection to the Splunk instance using either an authentication token or user credentials from the `user.conf` file, and then executes the queries. The results are saved in the specified output format, either CSV or JSON.

That's enough seriousness. Now let's examine the app with a use-case. üòä

### 1. Step: What we want?

At this stage, let's set up a scenario where we want four queries to run every day, as detailed below. Note that I've already defined a `mysql-local` connection and created a database table named `internal_mysql_tests`, along with a saved search called `Endpoint - oyku-xxx - Rule`. If you don‚Äôt have similar examples, I recommend creating them first.

```
my_internal_search_result
 -> index=_internal earliest=-15m | table host, log_level, sourcetype, _time | head  15
my_tstats_result 
 -> |tstats count where index=_internal by sourcetype | head 5
my_savedsearch_result 
 -> | savedsearch "Endpoint - oyku-xxx - Rule"
my_dbxquery_result 
 -> | dbxquery connection=mysql-local query="SELECT * FROM `internal_tests`.`internal_mysql_tests` WHERE timestamp > ? ORDER BY timestamp ASC"
there_is_no_such_an_index (it won't return any result)
 -> index=no_such_an_index

```

To run multiple searches efficiently, you‚Äôll need to define them in a structured input CSV file. Let‚Äôs assume our file is named **input_list.csv**. Each row in the file represents a separate search job with its time range, query, and output preferences.


*Here‚Äôs an example:*

```
title;earliest_date;earliest_time;latest_date;latest_time;spl;output_format;param
my_internal_search_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;index=_internal earliest=-15m | table host, log_level, sourcetype, _time | head  15;csv;false
my_tstats_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;|tstats count where index=_internal by sourcetype | head 5;csv;false
my_savedsearch_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;| savedsearch "Endpoint - oyku-xxx - Rule";csv;false
my_dbxquery_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;| dbxquery connection=mysql-local query="SELECT * FROM `internal_tests`.`internal_mysql_tests` WHERE timestamp > ? ORDER BY timestamp ASC" params="2025-09-02 17:05:39";csv;true
there_is_no_such_an_index;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;index=no_such_an_index;csv;false
```

**Column Descriptions**
- **title**: Static prefix used in naming the output file. The full filename includes a timestamp range (e.g., my_internal_search_result-01092025T000000_03092025T000000.csv).
- **earliest_date** / **earliest_time**: Define the starting point of the search window (%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S).
- **latest_date** / **latest_time**: Define the end point of the search window.
- **spl**: The actual Splunk query (SPL) to be executed. Must be valid and runnable in the Splunk UI.
- **output_format**: Desired output format ‚Äì either csv or json.
- **param**: Set to true if the query contains parameterized timestamps (e.g., in dbxquery); otherwise, set to false.

In this step, we don't need to worry about our **earliest_date**, **earliest_time**, **latest_date**, **latest_time** values. We will update them in the next step.

### 2. Step: Configure authentication 

By default, splunk_query_runner uses a Splunk authentication token stored in the user.conf file. This is the recommended and most secure method, especially for automated environments where you want to avoid exposing passwords or entering credentials manually each time.

The user.conf file should include a single line like:

```
eyJraWQiOiJzcGx1bmsuc2VjcmV0IiwiYWxnIjoiSFM1MTIiLCJ2ZXIiOiJ2MiIsInR0eXAiOiJzdGF0aWMifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJhZG1pbiBmcm9tIE95a3UuaG9tZSIsInN1YiI6InNwbHVua19xdWVyeV91c2VyIiwiYXVkIjoic3BsdW5rLXF1ZXJ5LXJ1bm5lciIsImlkcCI6IlNwbHVuayIsImp0aSI6IjgwMmMwZTFiYTViOThasdE1ZDZkYTA4ZGIzZGYxNGIxYmYyY2I3ZTc5YWRiZjhmNjRkMjQ1ZThmN2MxMzkzYWEiLCJpYXQiOjE3NTc2ODA2MTIsImV4cCI6MTc1NzY4MTIxMiwibmJyIjoxNzU3NjgwNjEyfQ.bdzfbzkGCIpu7uHmYkVaPVeMTatIQ9NhmleReEnCGMFdqKgEDu1_BdiCJgHcdB68P7TAnzXCtcL996ab1J-2kQ
```

If you don't know how to create an authentication token, you can use the `create_splunk_tokens` script, and you should probably check the [Splunk official documentation about it](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/authenticate-into-the-splunk-platform-with-tokens/use-authentication-tokens). You can choose to use a different user account specifically for this job with the **user** role. Alternatively, you should add specific roles appropriate for your situation. Additionally, since roles may vary across different versions of Splunk, I recommend checking the [Splunk documentation](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/admin-manual/9.3/manage-users/about-users-and-roles) for more information.

If you prefer or are required to use basic authentication with a Splunk username and password, the script can accommodate that as well. To enable this feature, open the `splunk_query_runner.py` file and uncomment the relevant lines (typically around lines 12 and 23‚Äì37). Once activated, the script will prompt you to securely enter your username and password at runtime instead of pulling a token from a file. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: I chose not to include user and password information in a file for security reasons. However, if you want to use this automated script with a username and password configuration method on a daily basis, you can add some lines to the `splunk_query_runner.py` script, although I do not recommend doing this.

### 3. Step: Run Everything with One Command

After your input file is prepared and authentication is set up, you can run the entire process with just one command. The included bash script, named all_runner_script, automates everything for you‚Äîthere's no need to manually update dates, clean folders, or enter lengthy commands. 

```
./all_runner_script
```

The script carries out the following steps automatically, in order:

**1. Creates the Output Directory (if necessary)**

The script checks whether the `outputs/` directory exists and creates it if it doesn‚Äôt. This folder is where all your result files will be saved, either in CSV or JSON format.

**2. Updates Time Ranges in the Input File**

If you‚Äôre using dynamic time windows (such as ‚Äúyesterday to today‚Äù), the script can automatically update the `earliest_date` and `latest_date` fields (params timestamp for the dbxquery function if you select true for the param value) in your input CSV file using the helper script `update_dates_for_input_files`. This feature ensures that your searches are always scheduled to run against the most recent data‚Äîideal for daily or hourly jobs.


If you are using dynamic time windows, such as "yesterday to today," the script can automatically update the `earliest_date` and `latest_date` fields in your input CSV file by using the helper script `update_dates_for_input_files`. Additionally, it modifies the parameter used in the **dbxquery** function if you select **true** for the *param* value. Please note that the parameters are only valid for the **"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"** timestamp format. If you want to change this format or other details, you will need to modify some code in the `update_dates_for_input_files` script. This feature ensures that your searches are always scheduled to run against the most recent data, making it ideal for daily or hourly jobs.

`before running the script`:

```
title;earliest_date;earliest_time;latest_date;latest_time;spl;output_format;param
my_internal_search_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;index=_internal earliest=-15m | table host, log_level, sourcetype, _time | head  15;csv;false
my_tstats_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;|tstats count where index=_internal by sourcetype | head 5;csv;false
my_savedsearch_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;| savedsearch "Endpoint - oyku-xxx - Rule";csv;false
my_dbxquery_result;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;| dbxquery connection=mysql-local query="SELECT * FROM `internal_tests`.`internal_mysql_tests` WHERE timestamp > ? ORDER BY timestamp ASC" params="2025-09-02 17:05:39";csv;true
there_is_no_such_an_index;01/09/2025;00:00:00;02/09/2025;00:00:00;index=no_such_an_index;csv;false

```

`after running the script`:

```
title;earliest_date;earliest_time;latest_date;latest_time;spl;output_format;param
my_internal_search_result;11/09/2025;00:00:00;12/09/2025;00:00:00;index=_internal earliest=-15m | table host, log_level, sourcetype, _time | head  15;csv;false
my_tstats_result;11/09/2025;00:00:00;12/09/2025;00:00:00;|tstats count where index=_internal by sourcetype | head 5;csv;false
my_savedsearch_result;11/09/2025;00:00:00;12/09/2025;00:00:00;| savedsearch "Endpoint - oyku-xxx - Rule";csv;false
my_dbxquery_result;11/09/2025;00:00:00;12/09/2025;00:00:00;| dbxquery connection=mysql-local query="SELECT * FROM `internal_tests`.`internal_mysql_tests` WHERE timestamp > ? ORDER BY timestamp ASC" params="2025-09-11 13:04:35";csv;true
there_is_no_such_an_index;11/09/2025;00:00:00;12/09/2025;00:00:00;index=no_such_an_index;csv;false

```

**3. Deletes Old Output Files**

To maintain organization and avoid confusion, the script removes old result files in the `outputs/` folder before generating new ones. This way, you are always working with fresh data.

**4. Runs the Python Script with All Parameters**

Finally, the script calls the main Python script (`splunk_query_runner.py`) with all necessary arguments, including the input file, time format, host, and token file. The Python script then:

- Reads each row in your input CSV
- Converts date and time into UNIX timestamps
- Connects to Splunk using the provided credentials/token
- Executes the SPL query
- Saves the results in the specified format with a timestamped filename

| *Figure 2*  Terminal output showing multiple searches running and file names being generated. |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Be aware that if a file name starts with **X_** as image below (`X_there_is_no_such_an_index_11092025T000000_12092025T000000`), it may be empty. Therefore, you should verify your query.

Sample Output:
```
Running query for: my_internal_search_result_11092025T000000_12092025T000000.csv
Running query for: my_tstats_result_11092025T000000_12092025T000000.csv
Running query for: my_savedsearch_result_11092025T000000_12092025T000000.csv
Running query for: my_dbxquery_result_11092025T000000_12092025T000000.csv
Running query for: X_there_is_no_such_an_index_11092025T000000_12092025T000000.csv
```

This all-in-one approach makes it easy to integrate Splunk query automation into your daily workflow, cron jobs, CI/CD pipelines, or external data processing chains‚Äîwith minimal manual intervention.

üîÅ Want to run it every day? Just schedule `./all_runner_script` with cron, systemd, or any scheduler of your choice.
