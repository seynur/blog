# Splunk Cluster Manager Redundancy -  Part 2: Implementation 
Cluster manager redundancy is a mechanism designed to ensure high availability and resilience in Splunk's distributed architecture. If one cluster manager becomes unavailable due to a failure or maintenance, another pre-configured cluster manager can seamlessly take over coordination duties for the indexers. Splunk provides multiple approaches to implement this,  such as automatic failover with heartbeat or manual failover using DNS redirection ([Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.1/Indexer/CMredundancy#Implement_cluster_manager_redundancy)). Also, I mentioned this subject on my previous [blog](cluster-manager-redundancy-in-splunk.html). ðŸ˜Š

In this blog, we're going with the **manual + DNS-based approach** for its simplicity and full control over the switch process. However, since we're running **everything on the same physical server** (*for testing and educational purposes*), we're not using distinct hostnames or external DNS. Instead, we'll configure everything using the **local IP**. ðŸ˜Š

ðŸ‘‰ So, don't get hung up on *why* we're applying redundancy this wayâ€Š-â€Šour goal is to make the mechanics of the setup crystal clear for you to replicate in your environment, whether production or lab.

Also:
* All examples and configurations will be demonstrated on macOS. Please don't be mad at me. ðŸ˜Š
* You'll need a Splunk Enterprise license to set up this type of environment.
* And since this blog is aimed at less experienced Splunk Architects, I'll include helpful context around basic Linux commands and core Splunk concepts where relevant.
* You can check my previous [blog](cluster-manager-redundancy-in-splunk.html) about what the Cluster Manager Redundancy is. ðŸ˜Š

If you are ready, we can start with outlining the steps and configuring all Splunks on the same server. After that, we will continue to discuss and configure advanced options.

## 1. Overview
[Distributed Clustered Deployment](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/pdfs/white-paper/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf) with multi-site (M2) contains at least *1 Search Head*, *3 Indexers*, *1 Cluster Manager*, and other components. In our scenario, we will have **1 Search Head**, **2 Indexers**, and **1 Cluster Manager** in **site-1** with another **Cluster Manager** and **the last Indexer** in **site-2**, as shown in the table.

| *Figure 1* Description of the component that will be used in this study. |



If you're not familiar with these components but still want to try this method, I recommend starting with [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.0/Capacity/ComponentsofaSplunkEnterprisedeployment) and taking some basic [Splunk courses](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/free-courses/overview.html). There are free starter courses available under the "*Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud*" section that you can find through the link I mentioned earlier. After you have learned some fundamental information, if you want to deepen your understanding of Splunkâ€™s architecture and networking, I suggest exploring additional courses. Otherwise, you can jump into this blog. Also, if you encounter any problems or have questions about the topics discussed in this blog, feel free to contact me via my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%B6yk%C3%BC-can/).

## 2. Create Splunk Environment
### 2.1. Install Splunk Enterprise for Each Component

If you want to continue, you should start to create some directories for each of Splunk's components. I simply created a directory called as ***splunk_9â€“4â€“1_cluster*** as a starter, because of using the 9.4.1 version of Splunk Enterprise. You can use the commands below to create all Splunk components.

```

mkdir splunk-sh splunk-idx1 splunk-idx2 splunk-idx3 splunk-cm1 splunk-cm2
wget -O splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.1/osx/splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz"

tar -C splunk-sh -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz
tar -C splunk-idx1 -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz
tar -C splunk-idx2 -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz
tar -C splunk-idx3 -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz
tar -C splunk-cm1 -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz
tar -C splunk-cm2 -xzf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-darwin-intel.tgz

```
Secondly, you can either start all Splunks individually to decide their ports or simply edit their ***etc/system/local/web.conf*** files before starting them. I will follow search head (***splunk-sh***), indexer 1 (***splunk-idx1***), indexer 2 (***splunk-idx2***), indexer 3 (***splunk-idx3***), cluster master 1 (***splunk-cm1***), and cluster master 2 (***splunk-cm2***) order to start Splunk and provide configurations for the ***splunk-idx1***. You may adjust the configurations as needed based on this example. By following my sequence, you won't need to make any new configurations for ***splunk-sh***, only for ***splunk-idx1***, and the other components.


Let's start with **option 1**:

**Notes:**
* If you are as passionate about password security as I am, you can use the credentials ***user:password*** with ***admin:admin123***. While the latter was a joke, itâ€™s crucial to prioritize strong password choices. ðŸ˜Š

* Also, because we are going to use default ports for the splunk-sh, please remember to start the Splunk service for the splunk-sh first. Otherwise, you need to make some adjustments.

* You can use this start command to eliminate the whole reading process ðŸ˜Š ```splunk-idx1/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes```

The image below shows what I changed while starting ***splunk-idx1*** component. Because we didn't create a cluster at this moment, I just changed *the Web Port*, *the Management Port*, *the Appserver Port*, and *the KV Store Port* of the ***splunk-idx1***. After all configurations, we will disable the web port and change the replication ports on the indexers. After we've made all configurations and created the cluster architecture, we will disable the web port and change the replication and input ports on the indexers.

|:--:| 
| *Figure 2* Terminal image of the Splunk installation with custom ports for the splunk-idx1 component. |


**Option 2**:
Create a ***server.conf***, ***web.conf***, and ***user-seed.conf*** under the ***etc/system/local*** directories for each main directory of the Splunk components. Also, I will give you the example configs for the ***splunk-idx1***.

```
# user-seed.conf
[user_info]
USERNAME = admin
PASSWORD = <your password>
```

```
# web.conf
[settings]
httpport = 8001
mgmtHostPort = 127.0.0.1:8090
appServerPorts = 8066
```

```
# server.conf
[general]
serverName = splunk-idx1

[kvstore]
port = 8192
```

After creating and editing these configs, you can start the Splunk service easily with the command below.

```
splunk-idx1/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt
```


### 2.2. Configure Environments as TheirÂ Roles
We will continue to create our cluster in this section, starting with the  ***splunk-cm1***. Please, just follow my lead and be patient, because this path is a little bit thorny. Also, don't forget to restart after configuring each component, and add your Enterprise license to CM1 at the end of the configuration. ðŸ˜Š

Lastly, we are creating a cluster as [*Splunk recommends*](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.1/Indexer/Clusterconfigurationoverview) and the architecture below, using the appropriate apps with correct naming conventions. ðŸ˜Š

### 2.3. Configuring Monitoring Console
If you follow my instructions carefully, you will reach the top. Congrats! ðŸ¥³

Now, we are going to configure the Monitoring Console, as written in the [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DMC/Configureindistributedmode).

##Â 3. WrappingÂ Up

With everything configured step by step, we've successfully set up a fully functional **Splunk multisite indexer cluster (M2) with cluster manager redundancy**â€Š-â€Šall running on a single server. This architecture, though compact, reflects how redundancy and failover logic work in production environments. Once your configuration is complete, you'll be able to monitor your cluster's **redundancy state** visually, just like in the image below. Active and standby components can be seen clearly. ðŸ˜Š

| *Figure 6* Monitoring activity of the Cluster Managers. |

Because we configured it as manual method, you can **manually switch activeness** between cluster managers whenever needed by running:

```

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cluster-manager-redundancy -switch-mode active

```

Yet, don't forget to edit all ***server.conf*** files contain the **management port** of the **CM1** on the indexers & search head manually as well. Before or after using this command. Also, you can check the status of the cluster managers with;

```

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cluster-manager-redundancy -show-status

```

After some configuration changes and applying the ***switch-mode*** command, we just achieved the image below. Now, the new active cluster manager is the CM2. ðŸ¥³

This setup not only gives you hands-on experience with distributed Splunk environments, but also lets you safely explore **manual failover** and **resilience planning** without requiring multiple machines. Hopefully, this guide helps you build confidence in configuring and operating complex Splunk topologies.

Now it's your turnâ€Š-â€Šspin it up, break it, recover it, and learn from it.

**Happy Splunking!** ðŸš€
